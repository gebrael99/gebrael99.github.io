      <description>Last Week of School Blog Post I did it, I managed to complete a really weird semester, and an even weirder year! Learning R and Python was one of my favorite parts of my year. Courses that will stick with me beyond the semester are so valuable, and I&#39;m excited to continue my coding journey next year. One of the recent things we learned was how to code Python within R markdown and how to share information between R and Python.</description>
