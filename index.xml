      <description>Last Week of School Blog Post I did it, I managed to complete a really weird semester, and an even weirder year! Learning R and Python was one of my favorite parts of my year. Courses that will stick with me beyond the semester are so valuable, and I&#39;m excited to continue my coding journey next year. One of the recent things we learned was how to code Python within R markdown and how to share information between R and Python.</description>

      <description>After spending too much time researching admission statistics for various medical schools, I decided to use my time more wisely by exploring a medical school acceptance dataset for my next project. The dataset is titled &amp;quot;MedGPA&amp;quot;, and includes information on 55 medical school applicants from a Midwest liberal arts college. The dataset includes 12 variables. Acceptance status is displayed both through letters (A for accepted and D for denied) and through binary (1 for accepted and 0 for denied).</description>

In my previous Biostatistics project, I collected data on the shooting percentages for basketball players during their careers in college and professional basketball.</description>
